## Run
```
.\runProgram
```

## What I learned

### Lesson1

```cpp 
#include <library_name>
```
This imports library or package that can be accessed and used in code.

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the indentifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it.

If this line is included, I don't have to reference std:: before a function call

std = standart

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello World!"
```
This line finds namespace in <iostream> library with a name of std and selects a function cout
  
cout = character output
